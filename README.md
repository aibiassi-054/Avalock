## Storyline

### Background
According to AgeUK, more than 800,000 older people in England and Wales reported being victims of fraud in the past year alone. People are now nearly three times more likely to be a victim of fraud than to be burgled and nearly 19 times more likely to be a victim of fraud than to be mugged. [(1)](#references)

Banking services are moving away from High Streets and into the digital space, leaving older generations technologically behind and most vulnerable to digital scams.
